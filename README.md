- 👋 Hi, I’m Travis!
- 👀 I’m interested in all things automated testing. I've tested professionally with Selenium WebDriver in C#, Java, and Python, JavaScript with Cypress and CodeceptJS, and APIs with RestAssured and Postman.
- 🌱 I’m currently reading the book _Test Driven Development with Python_ and following along with building a web app with Django and functional tests written with Selenium. You can see my progress [here](https://github.com/travwritescode/tdd-with-python)!
- 📫 How to reach me: send me an email!
