- 👋 Hi, I’m Travis!
- 👀 I’m interested in all things software testing. I specialize in developing suites of automated tests with JavaScript and Cypress.io as well as Python and SeleniumWebdriver.

  - Learning web development basics through The Odin Project curriculum. Follow along in my [daily log](https://github.com/travwritescode/travwritescode.github.io/blob/master/log.md)!
  - Building on my test automation portfolio. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/travwritescode/test-portfolio).
